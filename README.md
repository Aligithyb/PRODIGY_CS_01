# Caesar Cipher Python Program

## Overview

This project implements a Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This repository contains a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Convert plain text to encrypted text using a specified shift value.
- **Decryption:** Convert encrypted text back to plain text using the same shift value.
- **User Interaction:** Command-line interface for user input to choose between encryption and decryption.
